# I May Have Lost All Control But At Least I Found Your Bag

Welcome to your new summer job working at the Lost-And-Found kiosk at the Hotel Leaf, Moon, and Precipitation!  
Guests will occasionally turn up and ask you to find their things.  
All you need to do is retrieve their things from the cupboard behind you at the kiosk.

If something really wacky and or uncharacteristic happens, leading to you getting lost, never fear.  
Just use your spacebar, and follow the noise made by the kiosk.
And if you notice your controls getting lost, well, just keep an ear out for them.
